Today is one of those days when what you want to do is at odds with what you should do. You might try to speed through your obligations to get to the fun part. Instead of procrastinating, just push through.\nOn Monday, August 12, the moon in Scorpio squares the sun in Leo and your house of creativity, children, and fertility. Aries, you and your partner might be discussing the future of your relationship and how to grow your family. You could be thinking of creative projects that would bring in more income. Or you might be discussing how your family will expand through your children and your legacy.\n",

The first couple weeks of the month are your time to balance being playful with productivity, while the sun in Leo finishes its trek through your 5th house.\nThe new moon in Leo on August 4 is your chance to make a commitment to incorporating more recreational activities into your life, whether it means getting out in your neighborhood more, spending more time with your kids, or around them, or simply taking up a new hobby or pastime.\nThe same day of the new moon, amorous Venus moves into Virgo, joining Mercury, in your 6th house of productivity. It’s time to get organized and more intentional about your schedule, which will allow you to do more of the things you love, while still taking care of business.\nMercury goes retrograde on August 5, which is the perfect time for you to revisit projects that have fallen to the wayside. Make sure you’re giving enough time to your personal health and wellness, this also includes mental health. Exercise may feel more therapeutic than usual. Schedule breaks in between your work to get outside, even for a brief stroll through your neighborhood.\nThis time of year is especially auspicious due to the 8/8 Lion’s Gate Portal.

        "每年运势": "As the first sign of the zodiac, you’re often seen as a selfish lover, someone who is only out for yourself and who rushes into relationships without thinking things through. And while these things can be true, this year’s Saturn placement gives your love life a more compassionate energy that can take you in surprising new directions.\nSo, Aries, how much will Saturn’s pairing with gentle Pisces and your intuitive twelfth house really change your approach to love this year? Maybe not monumentally, but there will be important teachable moments. Perhaps the best thing this self-reflective planetary partnership does is stop you from moving too quickly. Rushing into the next hot romance is tempting and can definitely be fun, but this year is a good time to really think about the effect that going from one inconsequential relationship to the next has on your long-term well-being.\nWith that said, your first house of identity and self is alive with the sun’s vibrant energy during your birthday month between late March and late April, giving you the confidence to truly be yourself and approach your crush or a hot stranger and tell them exactly what you want. Your intense competitiveness is also in play now, which can “win” you the love of your life, but just make sure you really want what you’re going after. Sometimes you’re driven by the urge to win without really thinking about whether or not you want the actual trophy.\nOur lovely Luna—the moon—will make us especially moody and brooding today, Aries.

It’s a great time to tackle projects around the home that you’ve put off, or started and didn’t finish. The same day of the new moon, amorous Venus moves into Virgo, joining Mercury, in your 5th house of love, children and creativity. Why not make projects around the home a fun, family activity with friendly competition.

This is especially important because it occurs in the days after the new moon, giving every sign an extra blessing from the universe to make your dreams come true.\nWith your ruler Venus in the house connected to pleasure, it's time to prioritize even the simplest things that bring you joy. Commit to doing at least one activity a day that doesn’t involve work or serving other people. When Mercury goes retrograde in your sister sign Virgo on August 5, you’ll feel more inclined to revisit the things you loved when you were younger. What were your talents and hobbies when you were a child? Something that once made your heart sing may reignite your creativity.

A shiny object is tempting you, but it isn’t in line with your bigger goals. A large purchase today could throw off your budget for a while. Be careful about indulging in something that isn’t in your best interests.\nOn Monday, August 12, the moon in Scorpio squares the sun in Leo and your house of personal expression. Leo, your popularity is strong, but your patience is short. People want to see you, but they might not show up exactly when you want them to. Make this a happy day by stacking it with fun things to do. Don’t wait for others. Let them catch up to you when they can.\n",
        "每月运势": "It’s time to do what you do best and shine, Leo with the sun still in your 1st house of self for most of the month. We kick off the month with a powerful new moon in your sign on August 4, which encourages a fresh new start for you as you embark on your new solar year. The sun and moon send positive beams to Mars and Jupiter in your 11th house of hopes and wishes, and the north node in your 9th house of spirituality. This is a time for you to stretch yourself and set big goals.\nThis time of year is especially auspicious for you due to the 8/8 Lion’s Gate Portal. The alignment of Earth, Sirius and Orion in the constellation of Leo is an opportunity to focus on your manifestations and watch them unfold. This is especially important because it occurs in the days after the new moon, giving you an extra blessing from the universe to make your dreams come true.\nLove and pleasure planet Venus moves into Virgo in your 2nd house of income the same day as the new moon. Venus is also connected to what we value and rules your 3rd house of communication and 10th house of career. Venus in this house wants you to look at how your mindset about money and your self-esteem affect your long-term career goals and your reputation in the world.\nVenus in the 2nd house also brings a tendency to want to spend more on luxury items or creature comforts. While this is not necessarily a bad thing, Mercury goes retrograde August 5 in this same house, and may conjure up an unexpected financial responsibility that needs to be taken care of asap. It’s important to be financially cautious and meticulous about what is going out and coming into your bank account(s).\nAugust 19 is the most pivotal point of the month with the Aquarius full moon occurring in your 7th house of partnerships. The full moon coincides with two T-Squares involving Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Venus and the sun, moon and Uranus. Aquarius is your opposite sign, so this full moon will likely bring an unexpected development relating to yourself or someone you are close to.\nThe sun joins Venus in your 2nd house of finances on August 22nd for Virgo season. This further emphasizes the need for you to be fiscally responsible because your ruler will shine its light on anything that needs to be worked on and improved in this arena. Could it be time to ask for a raise or increase your rates/prices if you are an entrepreneur or contractor? A big theme for the month is owning and stepping into your personal power so you can have a more abundant life.\n",

You know that every strong emotion has the capacity to teach you something new, which is why you see each day of 2024 as a chance for a fresh start and a way to see things from a new perspective.\nTeacher Saturn is encouraging you to explore your personal attachments this year, Leo, including the people you’re attracted to, interested in, date, crush on, etc. The way you deal with things in your intimate relationships says a lot about the kind of person you are, and this year, you’ll be facing that issue head-on. Have you had unhealthy relationships in the past that are holding you back from being with someone now or in the future? Have your own unhealthy habits sabotaged your past relationships, either willingly or subconsciously? Does your need for control have to do with your current relationship status, and if the answer is yes, do you want to do anything about it? These are important questions to ask yourself this year.\nThe search for love doesn’t have to be so serious all of the time, though, which is evident at times like when love goddess Venus travels through airy Gemini from late May to mid-June. You love to get to know a lot of diverse types of people during this versatile transit, and you’re super curious about other people’s lives and interests. There aren’t very many limits now, and conversations flow smoothly when you have a lot of sexual chemistry with someone. If you’re interested in dating during this dynamic transit, a nonjudgmental Libra is a great match.\nThe sweet and spectacular moon will shift over the degrees of Scorpio today, Leo. This means she is bringing her sensitivity and soft energy to your solar fourth house of home, family, and domesticity.

The only issue is that Saturn's square to Mars on the fifteenth makes you cautious of your emotions and heart. While you usually wear your heart on your sleeve, the austere planet is asking you to take a step back and keep your cards close to your chest.\nWith...\nThe start of your month is full of romantic promise as a new moon in your confident first house appears on August 4 and helps you manifest your desires.

The same day of the new moon, amorous Venus moves into your sign, joining Mercury, in your 1st house of self. No one knows how to analyze a situation quite like you, Virgo. While Gemini shares your Mercury rulership, your earthly nature has a way of taking information to the next step, and doing something about it.\nThis time of year is especially auspicious due to the 8/8 Lion’s Gate Portal.

The combination of the 12th house and 1st house energy gives you the emotional awareness to look at the truth of a situation and the inspiration to make a change.

This mercury retrograde period should be used to get back in touch with some of your favorite confidants, especially the ones that overlap with your professional life.\nThis time of year is especially auspicious due to the 8/8 Lion’s Gate Portal. The alignment of Earth, Sirius and Orion in the constellation of Leo is an opportunity to focus on your manifestations and watch them unfold. This is especially important because it occurs in the days after the new moon, giving every sign an extra blessing from the universe to make your dreams come true.\nAugust 19 is the most pivotal point of the month with the Aquarius full moon occurring in your 4th house of home, family and ancestry.

        "每年运势": "There’s value in empowering yourself in all areas of your life this year, Scorpio, especially love. You aren’t always great at focusing on what makes you happy (you take pride in making other people feel good), but getting more in tune with what you need emotionally and physically can transport your love life to the next level in 2024.\nYour romantic year gets off to a bit of a bumpy start as both love goddess Venus and Mars spend time in fiery, spontaneous Sagittarius and your house of self-worth and need for security in the first week of January. A lot of romantic situations move a little too quickly for you now, and your feelings might be easily confused when you feel like you have to make hasty romantic decisions. If you’re trying to decide between two people, it will be very difficult to choose between opposites now.

We’re not saying you’re above having a hot fling this year, but if there’s no real connection with the people you’re with, there’s no hope for long-term love. In order to form a deep bond with someone during this time, you’ll need to click on a mental, emotional, and physical level.\nToday will bring a strong desire to check in with your feelings, Scorpio. This is because the sweet moon will become ignited within your zodiac sign—your solar first house of identity.

        "每日狗运势": "当其他狗在身边时，很容易做正确的事。他们明白先到先得。你的主人有不同的想法。你必须顺从，放弃骨头，哪怕只是为了炫耀。",
        "每日青少年运势": "今天一定要有人检查你更奇怪的冲动。你会被吸引的事情可能对你来说并不完全是坏事，但它们也不是完全有益的。与朋友协商购买和冒险特技。",
        "每日猫运势": "你现在和那些小伙伴相处得不好，需要做一些事情才能重新得到他们的好感。这不是你的错，你有更好的事情要做。只要把它们作为优先事项，事情就会好转。",
        "每日奖金运势": "向周围喋喋不休的人学习——三思而后行。",
        "每周运势": "This week, you’re finding a new way.\nThe week begins on Sunday, August 11, with Venus in Virgo making a quincunx to the North Node in Aries. You might have some challenges with your partner or a family member over spending habits. One of you could be spending more than the budget allows. Or there might be poor communication around finances. A disagreement is possible today.\nOn Monday, August 12, the moon in Scorpio squares the sun in Leo and your house of daily routines. Daily tasks could be frustrating today. It feels difficult to get things like dishes and laundry done. This could be due to boredom, resentment that you have to do it yourself, or frustration with the equipment you have to use. Pisces, solutions will come later.\n",
        "每月运势": "You start the month with the sun in Leo continuing its trek through your 6th house of work, service and daily routine, dear Pisces. You are reorganizing and streamlining. As a mutable, water sign, you have a go-with-the-flow demeanor, but this time of year is always important for getting your ducks in a row so you can move into the looming fall season with a greater sense of preparedness.\nAround the new moon in Leo on August 4, you can commit to implementing a new routine or structure in your life that makes you more efficient. This can be a new workout regimen, meal plan or work schedule. Saturn, our planetary teacher, has been in your sign since 2023, forcing a greater sense of responsibility on you, and now is a good time to implement what you’ve learned so far. It’s also a good time to schedule health checkups.\nThe same day of the new moon, amorous Venus moves into your opposite sign, Virgo, joining Mercury, in your 7th house of relationships. Mercury in the house that it rules will have you analyzing the partnerships in your life and if they are adding to or subtracting from your personal growth and development. When Mercury goes retrograde in your 7th house on August 5, you’ll get a chance to reconnect with people or a person from your past, if you choose to.\nThis time of year is especially auspicious due to the 8/8 Lion’s Gate Portal. The alignment of Earth, Sirius and Orion in the constellation of Leo is an opportunity to focus on your manifestations and watch them unfold. This is especially important because it occurs in the days after the new moon, giving every sign an extra blessing from the universe to make your dreams come true.\nAugust 19 is the most pivotal point of the month with the Aquarius full moon occurring in your 12th house of endings and the subconscious. The 12th house is connected to Pisces in modern astrology, so you feel right at home in this dream world. The full moon coincides with two T-Squares involving Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Venus and the sun, moon and Uranus. Pay attention to your dreams around this time and keep a dream journal. A profound transformation may be taking place.\nThe sun joins Venus in your 7th house of partnerships on August 22nd. You will be laser focused on teamwork and identifying with others. Coming off such a busy work period, your powers of collaboration may be put to the test, and you’ll need to adapt to another person’s style and way of being. You’re one of the most adaptable signs of the zodiac, so you’ll be up for the challenge.\n",
        "每年运势": "When it come to love, Pisces, you’re usually all in, and this year is no exception. You’re a starry-eyed dreamer who’s in love with the idea of love, but your expectations and hopes are often dashed by reality. In 2024, you’ll be using different techniques to make sure that your love life lives up to the expectations in your head. Will every effort result in a win? Of course not. But putting yourself out there more is guaranteed to bring better results than you’ve had in years past.\nYour self-image is experiencing a renaissance this year, so your love life is definitely going to be affected by all the changes you’re going through. On the one hand, putting more energy into yourself can leave less time for dating and getting to know new people. On the other, once you do make new connections, your improved personality will help you make positive first and second and third impressions.\nRemember also that your power planet Neptune is in your romantic sign again all year, which, like last year, can both help and hurt your love life depending on what other planetary influences are active at the time. You tend to have an overwhelmingly positive outlook on love, Pisces, but when your idealistic side takes over, your romantic bubble can very easily burst. Because of that, your happiness lies somewhere in between staying hopeful and letting go of unrealistic expectations.\nThe sweet moon soars through a fellow water sign today, a perfect energy for you to feel in touch with your desires to move in new directions, Pisces. The moon's light grants us a deep sense of emotional understanding, and wherever she transits, we can feel the energy that she is channeling. In a...\nThere are always one million reasons why you should stay at home and not attend a party that your partner is throwing. It's not that you are shy or don't enjoy their company, but you like to be alone and unwind after work before putting on a phony smile and being social. However, this week, you are...\nYour charm is undeniable as a powerful new moon in fiery Leo arrives on August 4. Balanced with your natural sense of shyness, it makes you quite adorable without being overbearing. Your personality appeals to a large number of people now, so making new romantic connections comes easily. If you’re...\n",
        "爱情运势": "双鱼座，揉搓你的太阳穴；你可能已经强烈地感受到水星逆行的头痛了！虽然这次过境现在突然影响了你的太阳生产力第六宫，但你可能会觉得工作中的一切都偏离了轨道。然而，处理这场戏剧的最好方法是和你的爱人坐下来，拔掉电源。生活中有些事情值得强调，但这不是其中之一。实际上，这是一个更好的快乐时期，可以享受一个迷你假期，而不是在虚空中尖叫。你和你的爱人会很高兴你变冷了。",
        "工作运势": "双鱼座，今天集中精力工作可能很有挑战性。当火星在双子座与木星在双子座相合时，你的个人生活中可能会发生许多新的、美好的事情。你很容易被个人生活中发生的一切分心。希望一切美好的事物都会降临到你身上。然而，如果你无法集中注意力，这可能会让你在工作中倒退，因为水星逆行也会进入狮子座。如果你不专注于工作，你可能会忘记一些事情或难以完成任务。",
        "约会运势": "你会感受到能量的波动，让你重新与日常生活联系起来。也许你发现自己和你想更好地了解的人有着相同的想法。"
